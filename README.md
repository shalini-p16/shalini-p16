# Hi there 👋 I'm a Cloud-Native Data Engineer 🚀

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Cloud-native Data Engineer** specializing in designing, building, and operating **scalable, production-grade data platforms** across **GCP** and **Azure**.

Currently at **Travix (Trip.com)**, I work closely with **marketing, product, ML, and analytics teams** to deliver reliable data solutions that power informed, data-driven decision-making.
