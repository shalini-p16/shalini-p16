Cloud-native Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience designing, building, and operating scalable, production-grade data platforms across GCP and Azure. Currently at Travix (Trip.com), I collaborate closely with marketing, product, ML, and analytics teams to deliver reliable data solutions that drive informed decision-making.

I specialize in building and maintaining large-scale ELT/ETL and streaming pipelines using Python, Airflow, Spark, Kafka, Flink, dbt, and BigQuery, with hands-on experience managing 300+ Airflow pipelines in high-availability environments. My work emphasizes data quality, governance, and observability, leveraging tools like Monte Carlo, Pytest, data contracts, and CI/CD with Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.

With a Master’s degree in AI (NLP), my background spans real-time IoT systems, ML-driven data products, and NLP pipelines, enabling automation, analytics, and product insights at scale. I’m passionate about building robust data foundations, mentoring peers, and translating complex data systems into measurable business value.
